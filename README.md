### ❓ Some common questions...

<details>
<summary>See them...</summary>

### 🤓☝🏼 "Can I add some additional mods?"
> Some mods might be incompatible with the mods that have been already added to Tweakify, so please, don't report bugs nor errors when using any other mod that it isn't on the original modpack. 
- I could maybe handle some bugs caused by "foreign mods" if you are planning to run an SMP. 
### 🤓☝🏼 "Where do I request adding mods or report a bug?"
> There's a GitHub repository where you can report issues or suggest mods or new stuff. Check it out at [here](https://github.com/munned/tweakify/issues)
