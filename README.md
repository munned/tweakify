### ☀️ Tweakify
> Been looking for a Vanilla+ modpack but nothing was a good option, huh? **Well, Tweakify has everything you're looking for**. This modpack **balances perfectly the performance and the quality** of slightly modded Minecraft (shaders and all of that).

---
### 🤔 Why Tweakify?
> The reason why you should use it is simple: **it won't make your frames drop**.

💫 Tweakify **not only relies on shaders**, but **mainly ResourcePacks**. 
> One significant ResourcePack that allows us to achieve that is **[Visual Effects+](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/visual-effects-plus) by [dosya](https://modrinth.com/user/dosya)**.

### ❓ Some common questions...

<details>
<summary>See them...</summary>

**🤓☝🏼 "Can I add some additional mods?"**
> Some mods might be incompatible with the mods that are already included in Tweakify, so please **DON'T report bugs nor errors when using any other mod that it isn't on the original modpack**. 
- I could maybe handle some bugs caused by "foreign mods" if you are planning to run an SMP. 

**🤓☝🏼 "Where do I request adding mods or report a bug?"**
> There's a GitHub repository where you can report issues or suggest mods or new stuff. Check it out **[here](https://github.com/munned/tweakify/issues)**.
